Project 1 for Creative Coding Fall 2019
- The Unexpected Machine: Performance Adjective

Adjective: struggled
- Idea comes from daily frustration of school, works, family issues, relationships, religion practice...
- Start with organized shapes, lines, and grids movements to show that "I" am trying to take control of everything in order;
- Once the mouse moves around the screen, it breaks the harmony and creates chaos and randomn of the shapes;
- It demonstrates that when an outer force interact with "my" life, things start getting out of control and messy;

Commentary about the code:
- Create a firework-effect line starts from the center point to show that "I" have a good and organized plan (everythingn starts good);
- Multiple grids and squares appear right after that, faster and faster, so give a sense of that things get busy but still in control;
- When mouse interacts with the screen, the lines and shapes change throughout movement, to show that "I" am starting to be struggled with life accidents.

Obstacles that I have:
- What is vercor? How should I use it.
  - https://processing.org/reference/PVector.html
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJkvxQXIa8 (Thank you Daniel Shiffman! Really helpful!)
  - Learning Process Chapter 6 about how to use map

- How to use time to make effects changing with time?
  - https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/Movie_time_.html ï¼ˆfor move)

- How to translate Javascript to P5js? (I start writing everything in Processing and took me really a while to traslate them)
  - https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/translate
